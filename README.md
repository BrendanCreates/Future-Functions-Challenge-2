# Future-Functions-Challenge-2
You are given a 2D array of integers envelopes where envelopes[i] = [w i , h i] represents the width and the height of an envelope. Each envelope has two colors.
One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope are greater than the other envelope's width and height, and also at least one of their colors match.

Return the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll (i.e., put one inside the other)

Note: You can rotate an envelope.
